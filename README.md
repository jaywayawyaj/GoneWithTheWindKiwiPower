# Gone With The Wind - Kiwi Power Tech Test

My TDD'd attempt at the Library tech test in Scala provided by Kiwi Power. My first attempt at using Scala and it's testing framework FunSuite. Full specification in the appendix.

## Technologies Used
 - Scala
 - Funsuite

## My approach

I started off reasonably clueless about Scala, strongly typed and function programming in general! Primarily I tried to understand these concepts better using official documentation as well as other internet resources(SGoogle, StackOverflow, Youtube etc).
